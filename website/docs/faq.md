# FAQ

## Is this library production ready?

The library has running in production at https://gully.to for last nine months. We are using this library for event based communication across seven microservices and for consuming external webhooks. Since the company is a small startup, we have not handled high volume. Take this a more of a proof of concept. We would love to help any organization who is interested in implementing the event graph.
