# Introduction

GraphQL eventbus is an abstraction layer on top of GraphQL SDL to publish and consume messages in a type-safe way. It is message broker agnotic: you can pick Kafka, RabbitMQ, or event in-memory EventEmitter and build your custom event bus. With features like code generation, API evolution without breaking changes, plugin system for logging and monitoring, and more, you can build a production quality event hub for your service architecture.
